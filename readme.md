# The Node Globals

The aim of this repo is to accompany a series of videos looking at the Node globals.

These are the objects that are available in all modules and that are specific to Node.js. This series will not look at those objects that are built-in to the language itself.

The full list can be found [here](https://nodejs.dev/en/api/v19/globals).
